## Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. Given the large volume of daily transactions, identifying fraud is critical for financial institutions to prevent losses. The dataset typically contains anonymized transaction details, including features such as transaction amount, time, and various encoded behavioral patterns.

## Key steps involved:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling imbalanced data by employing techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and undersampling to ensure the model does not become biased toward non-fraudulent transactions.

2. Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the raw data and normalizing/standardizing them to improve model performance.

3. Model Selection: Building and testing various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to identify the most effective approach.

4. Evaluation: Using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve to evaluate the performance of the models. Special emphasis is placed on recall to minimize the chances of false negatives (missed fraud).

5. Prediction: Deploying the final model to predict fraudulent transactions, ensuring scalability and efficiency for real-time detection.
